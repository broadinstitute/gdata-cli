gdata-cli
=========

This command line tool makes it easy for systems administrators to
perform and script tasks for Google Apps domains. We created this library
using Zend_Gdata, in order to migrate our 2000 users over to Google
Calendar. We hope you find it useful.

Installation
------------

	git clone https://github.com/phishy/gdata-cli.git

	cp config.php.example config.php

	Modify you configuration file as needed. This tool can chat with many domains simultaneously; so
	you can configure more than one.
